## Notes üìù

Firebase Remote Config was used to inject the API keys for our forex providers as it offers a layer of protection beyond the standard practice of directly bundling keys with the app. Ideally, a more secure and isolated architecture would involve complete decoupling, with all third-party API interactions occurring server-side, either through a dedicated backend or a cloud function setup. However, given the relatively light operational scope of this project, Firebase Remote Config provides a balance between security and simplicity, aligning with the project‚Äôs requirements while reducing overhead.
